    Originally this was a method in OpenAI's utilities module, but they seemed
    to have removed it. I found this online; it seems to do the trick.

    So far we only seem to use cosine, and this function could be simplified to
    just do that, but I keep the original version I found here just in case.
    Basically, seems to take a list of floats and a bunch of lists of floats and
    calculates the cosine of each entry between them.

    Math stuff, I dunno. Fancy!
